#Create a while loop

#loop condition and guard
#keep looping as long as the condition is true
#condition is whatever follows while
while  i <= 10:
     print(i)
     i += 1 #shorthand increment for i = i+1

print ("Done with loop")

#It initally begins as 1 and then you add 1 and then it'll be 2 and then continue the process until the value is equal to 10 because it is the max value
#last iteration would be 11 which has it exit the while loop ocndition and goes to the next line of code
